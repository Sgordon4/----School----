connect to server with filezilla with ur netid and password
this is what u put in with filezilla as server
sftp://cs309-sd-7.misc.iastate.edu
leave port blank
it may fail once or twice
its fine just let it do its thing
put that file in ur user directory in the server
run the following commands in the server
in terminal*
ssh net-id@cs309-sd-7.misc.iastate.edu
ssh SGordon4@cs309-sd-7.misc.iastate.edu
enter netid password
once ur in
do tmux new
go into the tmux
run mysql -u root -p
hit enter
type "Abundant space 421 points!" when it asks for pass
then in mysql type connect coms309_cynote
then hit ctrl+b followed by d
to detach from tmux but leave mysql running
then run the jar u pushed to the server thru filezilla
now i left the mysql on my server connection running
so i would suggest just try running the jar without the tmux steps
but if for some reason it doesnt work and cant connect to db, run the tmux mysql process
