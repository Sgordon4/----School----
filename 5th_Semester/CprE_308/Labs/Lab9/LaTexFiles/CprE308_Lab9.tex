\maketitle

\noindent These labs focused on decoding sections of the FAT filesystem, giving a deeper understanding of the setup of different headers. The example file image provides a realistic example, with the printed results helping to cement ideas.\\

\noindent I had never done any work with filesystems before, and was suprised with how smoothly these labs went. For some reason I got super stuck on printing out the root directory sizes though, which took a fair amount of time to fix. Other than that, I feel like this was a successful foray into filesystems and their headers.\\\\
