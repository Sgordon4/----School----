Programming Language:
- Language to communicate instructions to computer

Programs consisting of a pl should be able to express:
- Atomic expressions
- Composition (control flow)
- Abstraction

PLs for different paradigms:
- Imperative, functional, logic
> Functional and logic are good with recursion
> Logic models facts and relations

How to specify a PL:
- PL Software - takes a program and outputs a value
- Syntax (grammar) vs Semantics (Operational semantics, typing rules)


Grammar:
- Context free (Start, F, R, S)
   > Deriving parse trees
   > Ambiguity can be caused by no operator precedence and not defining LR assoc.

Typical PL Features:
- Arithmetic (Arithlang)
- Variables (Varlang, Definelang)
- Functions (Funclang)
- Memory Management (Reflang)
- Types (Typelang)
- Data Structures (List and Pair)
- Contril Flow (if-then-else)

- Prefix, infix, postfix
- Variable scope (bound and free)
- Functions as first class objects (Higher order functions)
