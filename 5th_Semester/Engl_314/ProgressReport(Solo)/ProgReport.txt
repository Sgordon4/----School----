Subject:    Progress report for Technical Description assignment.

To:         Prof. Brian Dewall

Dear Prof. Dewall:
    The purpose of this report is to update you on the progress of my team's
Technical Description assignment. The description focuses on 3d printing, giving
a beginner to the process a good understanding of the constituent parts and their
typical uses.
	To adequately fill out the description, we need to cover a description of 
a 3d printer, the different methods of printing, the stages in printing, 
materials used, and troubleshooting common problems that arise. Finally, the
document will need to be formatted appropriately, with images included where
necessary.
	All but the materials and troubleshooting are done, with final formatting
to be left to the end. The majority of the group had a fair knowledge base,
with each member able to provide some level of technical detail to the document.
The remaining work will be done this coming weekend (11/2-11/3), with the group
meeting at Parks library to finish the last sections.

Sincerely,
Sean Gordon
