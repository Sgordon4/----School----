    <Desc>No route keepin.</Desc>
    <ExtDesc>The route engine needs to have a route keepin shape defined to
 determine the area where routing can be added. The route keepin may or 
 may not be the same as the board outline. If no route keepin is defined,
 the size of the Allegro drawing is used. To avoid this warning, create a 
 route keepin shape.
