Mod 2 ----------------------------------------------------

Confidentiality: Encrypt with public (Pu) key, only user with private (Pr) can decrypt
Authentication: Encrypt with Pr key. If can decrypt with Pu key, you know it is from user with Pr

Best way to store Pu keys for public access is to register them with trusted authority, so
  that nobody can  impersonate a user and trick people into using their own public key.

--------

Symmetric key encryption is faster than Pu/Pr encryption, BUT each user needs a key for EVERY OTHER
  user, so thats a lot of keys. Pu/Pr only needs 2 per user.
If you need to encrypt a TON of data (~1 TB), you need to use symmetric keys, but how to send key?
SOLUTION is to create a symmetric key, and use Pu/Pr to send the symmetric key safely.
This key would be used temporarily for this one encryption instance, so you dont need to save it.
