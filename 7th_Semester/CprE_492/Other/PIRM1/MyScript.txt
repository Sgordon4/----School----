Hello, my name is Sean Gordon, and I will be talking about our projectâ€™s functional requirements. 

The bulk of our project focuses on designing addons to the existing Sisyphus table. These interfaces must build off the existing physical components of the table while requiring little to no customer intervention. The majority of the applications revolve around tracks for the table, giving customers much more accessibility to their existing product.

As the table operates using polar coordinates, our application will need to be able to convert from the preferred cartesian system to polar coordinates. The application will also enable custom track design in several ways. The most straightforward of these is a digital drawing pad, taking user input as a series of lines drawn on the screen.

Another function of the application will be to convert an image into a valid track. This function must intake an image of any type and resolution and allow the user to select what section of the image is to be converted. The function must then determine the most prominent aspects of the image and the order with which they must be layered, then convert these calculations into a cartesian coordinate file.

On top of enabling the creation of custom tracks, this application must also be able to send the tracks to the table itself. At this point in the project, it is uncertain whether this can be done using the preexisting wireless functionality of the table, or if further physical components like an arduino must be added.

The interface will also allow users to share tracks with each other, uploading the track to our online site for download. This functionality would also include naming, rating, and searching for a track using criteria like size.

All the services mentioned must fit inside a neatly packaged application like a smartphone or web app, and must be accessible through a graphical interface.
