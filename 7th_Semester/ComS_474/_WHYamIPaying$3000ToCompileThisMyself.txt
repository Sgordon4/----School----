This should be ready.
There is NO reason I should need to compile this asshat's lecture and homework PDF's.
I am not paying this inflated price for half-assed half-assing.

This is absurd. Some of these lecture files have incorrect formatting. This guy was intentionally RKOed at birth so that he'd at least have an excuse for being a pinhead.

I am actually debugging this guy's LaTex so I can see his shitty powerpoint slides, so that I can go off onto the internet and teach myself. What an absolute joke.
