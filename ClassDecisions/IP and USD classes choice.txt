Music 102 -It's a super fun class and the extra credit opportunities never stop coming. You basically listen to 
different pieces of music and are given questions about them. Every few weeks you have a test and 2 tries to take it. 
You are required to go to 8 concerts through the semester, but with the ridiculous amount of extra credit that is 
offered in that class you don't even have to. I had a hard time finding time to go to concerts, and I still made 
an A in the class. Before each test, you are given a "practice test" for each chapter the test covers. All you have 
to do is complete the practice tests and each one of them is worth 5 extra points towards your test. You don't even 
have to get the questions right. You could literally click random bubbles and get the 5 points, and that's often 
what I did. So basically, you can get a fair amount of questions wrong on the actual test and still get more than 
100% on it. The final is optional, and the classes are a lot of fun to go to. You listen to music and the professor 
explains what is going on in the music. Since they use music from all over the world, it counts towards international 
perspective. You would have to really put in zero effort to not receive a passing grade in this class. Reading this 
entire comment is probably more difficult than passing this class, so if you're finishing this sentence, go sign up 
for music 102.

Globe 220 - this is an intro to world energy problems. If you are an engineering major (or anything math-based) 
this will be a cake walk. Taught in 3 sections, testing center exams. Easy A, relatively interesting.

WLC 119 had no tests or quizzes, but mandatory attendance. Discussion based, one very small project.

TSC 220 is the opposite. Very easy course (assuming you know basic math, most of the people that struggled are 
non-stem majors who take this elective because it does require a fair amount of math), no need to show up, 
just do the HW and the tests which are the same as the HW.
an interesting and easy class if youâ€™re interested in renewable energy and saving the environment. 
Minimal work and tests are straightforward

RUS 375(Russian 375: Russian Today),
It's an online, 3 credit, half semester class that meets you IP requirement and you'll spend maybe a max of 3 hours 
total doing work in the class. (The class is taught in english)
NO--------

T SC 220 and Globe 220

AFAS 442. Super easy, and very interesting.

USD:

History Of American City (Arch 321 or Design 321). Like 3 short papers, 3 essay exams, otherwise no homework.

I took AESHM 342, which looks at things like how the colors of the walls of a restaurant affect consumers, and 
things like that. I took it online over the summer and it was super easy.

Econ 321
